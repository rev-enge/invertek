# Repairs done.

These boards have been repaired multiple times.

## Sympthom: White led(s) below the logo do not lit any more, or weak.

In most cases the LEDs are broken, probably due to a too high current.

A (replacement) partnumber of the LED is:  LW E67C (Brand Osram)
The 2 leds are connected in parallel so its best to replace them both.
Also replace R51 (original 56E) with a resistor of 120E to lower the current.
