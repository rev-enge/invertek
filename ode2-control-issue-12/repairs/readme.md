# Repairs done.

These boards have been repaired multiple times.

## Sympthom: Some display segments do not light up or very dim.

Broken / increased resistance of one of the 470 E resistors in series with the
 (led) diplay.

These are located left above the display (4x) and reight below the display (4x).

## Sympthom: Display segments completely missing (or all segments very dim).

The boards are notorios for disconnected via's. So probably on the the kathode
 side of the digits is disconnected. The kathode side of the display is
 connected to the drain of an MMBF170 N-Fet (also use for button multiplexing).
So measure if the pin from the display is connected to the right fet (D) pin.
